This is the UCL COMP0113 Virtual Environments courswork for group 6.

This project was conducted with Unity and UCL ubiq: https://github.com/UCL-VR/ubiq

## Intro
This project presented a collaborative avatar customization and interaction system designed for use in social virtual reality (VR). Inspired by platforms like VRChat and games like dodge ball, our system allows uses to experience playful presence, and rich social engagement. Our project allows multiple users to create, customize avatars in a shared virtual forest scene. Our avatars take the form of cat-like slimes that and then used to engage in real-time, and have dodge-ball-like interactions where players can throw objects at each other.
